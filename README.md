Don't Use Mouse. It's a K2M (Key to Mouse) app that binds mouse actions to wasd + q,e + some modifier buttons, so you won't have to move your hand each time you need to use your cursor.

Usage:

    Caps Lock: Hold or Switch depends on bHoldCapsLock in config.ini (Shift + Caps Lock: Simulates CapsLock action)
    
    WASD: move cursor

    Q: left click
    E: right click
    
    Hold Shift/Alt: Accelerate

    Z: Back or LeftArrowKey depends on bUseArrows in config.ini 
    X: Forward
    C: Middle Mouse Button
